# Begin to Code - Building Apps and Games in the Cloud

This is the resources site for "Begin to Code - Building Apps and Games in the Cloud" by [Rob Miles](https://www.robmiles.com)

## About the book
This book does not teach programming from first principles. It is for readers who have some prior programming experience, ideally in JavaScript, and want to use their skills to create and deploy cloud based applications.
## Buy the book

You can buy a copy of the book on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/Begin-Code-Building-games-Cloud/dp/0138065403)
## Sample Code

You can find links to the sample code on the book site [here](https://begintocodecloud.com/). Some of the sample programs run in your browser, others are provided as Git repositories that you download. Full instructions are provided in the book. The sample code is hosted as a GitHub organisation you can find [here](https://github.com/Building-Apps-and-Games-in-the-Cloud)

## Walkthrough Videos

The book contains links to walkthrough videos which are linked to the practical exercises. There are 67 of these and you can find them in on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7zNOp_WVLyWX6Cg47cu2K36VErZing-m).

## Hardware Requirements

You can do much of the practical work in the cloud, using your browser to run and debug code in the sample pages. For the larger examples you will download applications onto your computer. You will need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download). You do not need a powerful computer to do this. You can do all the work on a Raspberry Pi 4 if you wish. All the code demonstrations were performed on a low performance laptop.

If you want to perform the Internet of Things (IoT) examples you will need a Raspberry Pi computer and a few electronic components. A full parts list is provided in the book along with the circuit diagrams.
